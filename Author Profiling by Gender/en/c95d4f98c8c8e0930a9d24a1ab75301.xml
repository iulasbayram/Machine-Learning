		<document><![CDATA[I don't know why, but I absolutely love this location. It looks so awesome. https://t.co/yu5Zeu6n7R]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SamTheTrainFan How come it looks like that for you?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Won't lie, this doesn't look all that great. Look at the huge gap. https://t.co/hLgZm5vGRb]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JonathanAsiama2 hmm what episode is this?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So, what's the verdict? Retweet for everyone :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CarsonMarenka Help us Carson. You're our only hope.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And that's a wrap. Will be doing a more in depth review of the season soon!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Useful Railway: Loved it. Loved the crash. Love Rex. Love the animation. (if you couldn't tell, I like Rex)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Mike's Whistle: It was really good, but the comedy felt a little overplayed by the end. It's still up there with the best, though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Tit for Tat: RWS adaptations?! OMG!! This episode had everything. Animation was great, and Thomas' role wasn't that bad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Skiff and the Mermaid: Loved the humour and loved the innovative concept. Nice to see the Little Western gang together again. TFC was funny.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hugo and the Airship: The concept was a little strange. Not much really happened, and the montage was kinda odd. Still not that bad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Engine of the Future: It grew on me. A LOT. Duncan and Sir Handel were awesome and I can't wait to see more of Hugo. Nice music too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Buckled Tracks: Not much to say on this one. I can't tell where the focus is meant to be, and Flynn's voice is a bit annoying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[All in Vain: Finally, a James episode that I like (that's pretty rare) Great to see Edward finally do something, and the animation was 👌🏼]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Cautious Connor: Finally, Connor gets an episode! Loved it. Loved Stephen's speech at the end too. Great episode all around.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Mucking About: Nice to see Max and Monty, as well as The Pack. Not the best, but not the worst either. The twins are a bit dumb though :P]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Three Steam Engines: I actually do like this one. Nice to see the Ffarquhar trio back again. Also, Trevor is back, so that's cool.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Missing Breakdown Train: Awesome to see Judy and Jerome. They are such great characters who deserve more exposure.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Henry in the Dark: So, the scaredy becomes the scarer. Henry is in character yet again, and the episode has a innovative concept.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Over The Hill: A fun episode with the two old timers. The music was great too. Also, Thomas doesn't speak. Yay.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Christmas Coffeepot: Kinda forgettable, but really nice to see Glynn again. Nice reference to TFC building the coffeepots.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Railcar and the Coaches: Annie and Clarabel are evil but I love it! The dynamic between the three is so fun to watch, and I hope we get more]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Love Me Tender: Welcome back twins! Another amazing episode. SO happy to see the twins again, and perfectly in character too,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Letters to Santa: Loved seeing Percy and Harold together again. I love the callbacks to the RWS and the ending was very sweet. Love it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The Way She Does It: Nice to see Daisy again. I do like the episode, but can see its flaws.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Blown Away: 10/10 I am BLOWN AWAY by everything the episode has to offer. Duck and Oliver finally have a role (YAY) and Skiff is amazing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Pouty James: It's alright, but the novelty of the faces got old after a few viewings.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Ryan and Daisy: I love it. Characters are great and it's great to see a new side of Daisy that the models couldn't capture(look at the eyes)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Saving Time: A rather dull and slow episode. It's ok I guess, but definitely not my favourite.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Bradford the Break Van: Nice to see a new rolling stock character. Watching him boss everyone around was very entertaining. + Whiff speaks.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Diesel and the Ducklings: Average. Maybe even below average. I found the episode pretty boring, and I don't see myself going back to it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Henry Gets The Express: Welcome back! One of my wishes was fulfilled, and I couldn't be happier. What else can I say? Perfect.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Toby's New Friend: A nice, slice of life episode. Great to see Toby have a substantial role again. Him and Philip have great chemistry.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Sidney Sings: Fun and simple way to start of a season. Nice to see an underused character get used.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Incoming Season 20 thoughts]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I hope we get 1080p logoless versions of the Arlesdale episodes soon. I wanna use clips in my videos :P]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thomas' role was so minimal and I'm so happy. Honestly, you can hardly notice him there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SamTheTrainFan just pains me to see him there clearly, but he doesn't do or say anything.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I liked TFC role in SATM. I mean, if I was stranded on a boat in the ocean, I would be shit scared and act out like that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Gotta say, Skiff and the Mermaid was pretty brilliant. I would've liked some of Toad's lines to go to Oliver, but still good overall.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This should've been Duck and Oliver. I mean cmon, give him more roles! https://t.co/YS6ccRsOBD]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Whenever I see there are lots of tweets unread, I keep assuming someone uploaded Skiff and the Mermaid :P]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Is it Arlesburgh Junction or Arlesburgh West? Make up your mind.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You know what? I like the conflicting views of everyone on here. It makes conversations a lot more fun. Keep at it people!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hmm. Rex's bogie wheels didn't disappear in these episodes. That's nice.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SamTheTrainFan That looks pretty poor.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SunilFan48 I doubt they'll drop them. I think they're gonna pull a Skarloey Railway on us.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[For me, my favourite Arlesdale episode is a tie between Useful Railway and Tit for Tat. Both episodes are handled amazingly.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Say goodbye to the Arlesdale Railway. I doubt we're gonna see much of them in the future unfortunately.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SamTheTrainFan Yep. Noticed that first viewing. The wheels look quite bizarre.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@turtlesanthomas the slow motion crash was fine for me, but the gag in mikes Whistle just got so dull after the first time]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[The more I watch EOTF, the more I like it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They focused too much on the novelty of an engine like Hugo, rather than giving him a reason to be on the island.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@UsefulEngine23 what episode is the first image from?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The music in EOTF was pretty top notch. The whole sequence at the Shunting Yard was nice, especially the strings at he start.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SamTheTrainFan shhh I didnt think that one through]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hugo's face looks a little but ridiculous here. https://t.co/nCeShWOmtC]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The montage in HATA would've felt more rewarding if something actually happened. I mean, it feels like 2 minutes of filler.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I preferred EOTF to HATA by a long shot.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Awwww I love Hugo.]]></document>
