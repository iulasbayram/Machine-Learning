		<document><![CDATA[And here I'd forgotten what it was like to make strangers angry on Twitter. I think it's been almost a week! https://t.co/73NLcL1BPO]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@aoiph well, not up to you or I to say how anyone should be acting ever. But we're human. I find his silence disappointing – it's an opinion]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Even now, with Trump's Muslim ban causing outrage worldwide, he's too busy tweeting selfies and promoting his Fifty Shades Darker song.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[When he left One Direction, I thought it would be really interesting to see what he did – he had such potential to be such a strong voice.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@FacesByGrace omg when I saw your snap of us I was like, "who's that young boy?" IT WAS ME 😱]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sherqui @irishstu @lav maybe it levels out? Still, BIK thing is impossible to monitor]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sherqui @irishstu @lav oh yes. Take your point! So if you pay your own way you can claim tax BACK; if you get a freebie you've to pay.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sherqui @irishstu @lav but that's a separate issue imo.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sherqui @irishstu @lav totally – none of those reviews can be "honest", unless you pay your own way (and you're not recognised)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sherqui @irishstu @lav no. Eg You can't make a foundation better for a reviewer. You can make a meal special: food, service etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@EmerTheScreamer @beatingblog omg same. And PR hay is like shavings from a lathe; you NEVER rid your home of it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@irishstu @lav no, resto reviewers pay for their meals b/c they need to be relatively anon. Review isn't genuine if resto is treating you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@beatingblog eg 9 times out of 10 you don't need a voucher / trip abroad / handbag / jo malone candle in order to do your job.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@beatingblog well then maybe the mag should foot the bill for items required to "do the job", no? And tbh most freebies are not essential]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@irishstu @lav well, no, bc (I may regret saying this) I don't post re 90% of what I get. I don't work in exchange for product, basically.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lav @adrianweckler but a "legit biz exchange" is a payment in kind, unless I'm mistaken? Eg, you could have a loan of a gadget for review.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@beatingblog oh THAT'S interesting. I guess the individual, unless the mag got to keep the loot?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lav well, yes – but beyond that, seems like a rule that never existed until Revenue made it up]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MsRachelMc as a writer i.e. artist, I think so. As a writer i.e. journo / blogger, it's the same as every other job.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And I mean ultimately, I don't want to break the law. So should I start returning everything I'm sent? Can I claim tax relief on postage?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I know I'm like a dog with a bone but (a) I think Revenue plucked this statement out of thin air &amp; (b) I don't think anyone will ever comply]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also it'd be interesting to know U.K. policy. Do ppl like @CarolineHirons and @modelrecommends have to pay BIK tax on unsolicited freebies?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And if no one is paying BIK on their free tat, then hey, Revenue, this feels like an easy win! You've loads of money to collect!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Because surely if this is law – and, according to Revenue, always has been – then there are journos / bloggers out there adhering.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If I worked @thejournal_ie I'd be asking Revenue for a breakdown of BIK on free gifts collected from ALL media over the last 5 years.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I mostly want to know how you do it. Do you send things back? Surely we draw the line at paying BIK on things we don't want?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Journos / bloggers: I'd love to know if any of you are regularly declaring to Revenue and paying BIK on unsolicited freebies. Anyone?]]></document>
