		<document><![CDATA[@adam_lewis @sawngswjakec I once only liked pulp-free OJ. One day I bought pulpy OJ accidentally. I was weirded out by the pulp texture.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@barrysaunders @adam_lewis Don't know them! What were they like?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davecarter That's right - they have Barnesy/INXS doing 'Good Times' and The Wrights doing 'Evie', not the originals.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davecarter The UK/US rock canon is mostly 65-75 but it's more 76-86 in the Oz rock canon.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davecarter Which is interesting cos The Easybeats and Thorpey at Sunbury are held up as epochal by a doco like Long Way To The Top.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davecarter Boys In Town is their highest at #127...it's very very blokey.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davecarter But also no Billy Thorpe or Easybeats in the entire list - very little 60s/early 70s stuff in that list (not enough sheen?)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davecarter Of the top 100, the only post-1990 Aussie stuff is Baby Animals, Screaming Jets, Spiderbait's Black Betty, and Gotye/Kimbra.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davecarter I reckon this 2014 MMM countdown is instructive as to the Oz Rock canon: https://t.co/expftdIyQ1]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@barrysaunders @adam_lewis There's also heaps not on Spotify etc for licensing reasons or cos the record company has forgotten it exists.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davecarter @staffo_sez And the production style of Mark Opitz, looking at his credits here: https://t.co/gGN9wgV5iW]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@adam_lewis Mostly I was imagining a world where there's an established route for e.g. a Vic Simms or Screamfeeder reissue to get attention.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davecarter @staffo_sez And it's basically mainstream music, or aiming to be, that could get into the charts (so add Powderfinger, Jet, etc)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davecarter @staffo_sez Standard rock instruments, pop song structure, distinctive singer, ethos of masculine perhaps-larrikin mateship...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@awardtour What's the story there?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_jbradley @staffo_sez The juxtaposition between who's on the rock Long Way To The Top doco and who's on the pop Love Is In The Air doco?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@staffo_sez I mean, the stereotype of Oz Rock in my head is ACDC, Angels, Chisel, Hunnas, Hoodoo Gurus, Mentals, Paul Kelly, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_jbradley @heckelfonic Side question: Who/what created the Oz rock canon? Is there anything more to it than 'what Triple M plays'?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_jbradley @heckelfonic ...but I totally agree that their focus on dad-rock is almost comical these days.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_jbradley @heckelfonic Oh, those mags very much push the 'this stuff you heard on the radio growing up is actually quite deep!' thing...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@adam_lewis But I do think Australia is missing a local Uncut/Mojo/Rolling Stone equivalent to push such claims to new generations.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@adam_lewis Honestly, I think critical consensus is that Don Walker, Paul Kelly, etc are geniuses, but maybe the public isn't there yet.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gisellenguyen Yep: if yr body is adjusting to missing some mood-altering chemicals it got used to, odd moods are an obvious side effect.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@matt_levinson Also makes me wonder when Turnbull &amp; co will follow suit with similar blanket policies to appease the hard right.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@matt_levinson Well, no. It does put a lie to the fig leaf of them doing it because they really care about stopping deaths at sea though.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@penelly @goldfishlaugh Like they've been pushing the bounds of civility and dominating meme culture. The meme encapsulates all that.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@adam_lewis In contrast, I think @heckelfonic was right to push back against Wildflower - she very clearly *got* what the record was about.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@adam_lewis So yr serious music bros saying, e.g., 'Lemonade is overrated' are usually really saying 'stuff not aimed at me is overrated'.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@adam_lewis IMO 'overrated' is an argument about what music we should pay attention to, &amp; is often (but not always) about cultural capital.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@_jbradley But I reckon that there wasn't much impetus to define them until domestication - before that they'd have just been 'wild fowl'.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_jbradley There have definitely been wild ducks swimming around in ponds since forever, and humans trying to eat them...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_jbradley I figure in medieval Spain, the person asking you to serve duck for dinner is more likely to call it 'patt' rather than 'ente'.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_jbradley This suggests ducks were widely domesticated in Europe only from the later middle ages: https://t.co/2o1R9sIQWZ]]></document>
