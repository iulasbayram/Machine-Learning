you, dumb: not my throat! I need that for making throat-based complaints!!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[i.e., imagine they're human and that they have interests other than being the token woman on the "women in [insert field] panel"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Next, signal boost women. Retweet, reblog, mention in posts, invite them to speak at conferences, etc. This includes their non-activist work]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They don't owe you their un-paid time, and as I said in the first piece of advice, it's already publicly available.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Next, don't ask women to do shit for you. Writing detailed, tailored advice for *you* on how to be a half-decent guy is WORK.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A woman is an expert on her own body and emotional state. So don't tell her what is/isn't traumatic to her]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Compliments on appearance are fine but if 100% of your compliments are appearance-based women hear "I'm a decoration, not a person"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Another thing to try doing if you're a guy: make an effort to compliment women on something *other* than their appearance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One such example is @sehurlburt who's an accomplished programmer + business person who also makes efforts to uplift marginalised folk]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'm pretty sure I saw this prompt from @leighalexander years ago. At the time I couldn't name a single woman now I can think of many.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Next, figure out who the women you admire are. Your wife, mother, etc etc don't count - that's another excuse to put no effort in.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[First, listen to women when they speak. "But you said they don't trust me!" Yes, but there's plenty of women who are public speakers/writers]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So here's practical advice, from someone who's gone from "LOL women's studies" &amp; "it's women's fault if they stay w/ abusers" to... not that]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The first few times you kiss, drive, or cook it can be difficult, awkward, or scary. The solution isn't no romance, transit, or food.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Don't use the "I don't know what to say/do" or "I might make things worse" excuse. That's convenient because it lets you do nothing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also, make no mistake: this is as much a reminder to ME as it is a message to other men. I've made *a lot* of mis-steps.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[you but it's heard as, "I won't stand up for you when you're down-trodden, I'll down-play your trauma"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also, stop saying how "politics don't really affect you" or that you "don't pay much attention to politics". This might sound innocuous to]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If your first reaction is to question her clothing choices after being assaulted that is straight-up immoral on your part. Don't do that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If you ever say "what did she expect" to a woman's face or in convo w/o women present... that shit is way out of line.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. But it's not a get-out-of-jail-free card. "I'm not a rapist" is hardly something to brag about]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Another thing: you don't "support" women's rights by saying "I support women's rights". That's just a bunch of words you've said. Get real.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Example of being belittling/blaming her: "She should've-" nope stop right there. She shouldn't have been harassed/assaulted, period.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If you don't hear about it, it's because you're repeatedly silent when people belittle/blame women who've been harrassed/assaulted]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If you don't hear about it, it's because the women around you don't have confidence that you'll take them seriously and/or not blame them]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A majority of women I know have been. And the amount of women confiding to me about this has directly correlated with *my* behaviour]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Airports are for flying planes, catching flights, picking people up — not protesting. Yet protests (rightfully) occurred there.]]></document>
