		<document><![CDATA[@JayHarvie @NZ_Dave For Diamonds and SO, yeah. Maybe Rapa and PNM, but who cares about them? Seatoun and UH no good… https://t.co/IfntiNYxJ5]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@EnzoGiordani @PhlClaytn It was a bloody good match, which really helped. :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 @Wimble_Wombat @gingereejit He'd better. @AliceCooke3 needs to get those yellow cards :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@EnzoGiordani @PhlClaytn Nah, his club are still playing on Sundays.
It might also mean more blogstering from me...… https://t.co/cHyYc2rJ1t]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wimble_Wombat @patrick478 We never got Patrick last year. Just a few lines. I think we'll lose Selwyn. Not sure about the other ones.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wimble_Wombat I've only talked to Sandy about it, and she's for it. The refs is going to be fun. Unless we get @patrick478 all the time.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I, for one, am very pleased with this change (and the six team league). Looking forward to #WCL17. https://t.co/SSzH61TNR2]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jayharvie I walk past some WCC flats on the way home everyday and there's pretty much always smokers hanging out. No enforcement, no care.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jayharvie Yeah, i know it's possible, and WCC are starting on it, it's just going to take a serious culture change here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jayharvie Do they do it like HK airport, with dedicated smoking rooms that are not pleasant to walk past as the door opens?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jayharvie It's a great idea, I just don't really see it working.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jayharvie It's unenforceable. And unless WCC have changed their tune, it says so in all the press releases.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I managed it. Now I'll caption some random ones and upload them.

Actually, I wasn't the only media there. Photosport was there for half.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall Should have switched to the next tab. It's @matroidunion instead :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nzphotomac You mean like Qatar's air conditioned stadiums?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall It looks obnoxiously invasive. Here's my current screen.. https://t.co/FxuPhrQYIu]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall I use Twitter on computer, phone, and website. So unfortunately I just need to block the crap out of peeps. Working pretty good atm]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Can I be bothered editing the photos from the Weenix game? I was the only media there...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall I honestly have no idea. It'll probably depend on how Bill does. I just want it late so I can stay on Twitter longer :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall I'm guessing as late as possible so they can bankrupt Labour with as many pointless by-elections as possible.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall Yeah, this trick only works with 2 parties. Though National are doing pretty good all by themselves at the moment...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall If Labour and the Greens played their cards correctly, they could clean up massively under MMP.
Thankfully they don't.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall I know this is joke, but that sounds awesome. :P]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 Double point (the other cable is always down for maintenance when this happens), but yeah. Not enough redundancy...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 It's 'wee' when their usual is "some dumbarse farmer put a digger through our cable"...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 Still awesome if it's not actually beer? :P]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Tried to get @tacmoy to play beer pong. She sucked, even when she was dropping the ball...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yakcall Oh, I've blocked all the greens already. That's just a matter of principle :)

TBH, I'll probably just bail when that happens.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yakcall There's following, and then there's perpetual outrage and mockery. It's the latter I was sick of months ago and started blocking.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yakcall Most of mine showed up in RTs/quotes, so I blocked those accounts. Plus I follow basically no Americans...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yakcall Wow. That guy makes the Standard seem sensible.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yakcall Mine is pretty American Politics free. But my block list is very, very long...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yakcall That makes a little more sense. I looked her up. It's still fairly incoherent.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yakcall Does that say "Wank Paula Rebstock"?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@enzogiordani If only it was MySpace, then we could be Mutton.

I may be quite hungry...]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@enzogiordani We should demand a special 'don't forget about the little man' button...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@enzogiordani Yup. It seems to be designed for large organisations that actually get messages. Not us nothing football fans.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@enzogiordani Yeah, I'm at 15. And I'm much newer than that...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@enzogiordani Regularly? I get few, so if I've got the button it means 'got a message in the last day or so'. I care a lot less than you...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@enzogiordani I think you need to get lots of first-time messages in order to keep it.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@JayHarvie So you can find a light switch. Well done, I guess.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall Do you delete all your tweets on a regular basis so you can reuse jokes without anyone knowing?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thejourneyfan It does. It's buried somewhere. I've never used it.
More importantly, the AF play nice?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thejourneyfan How was the camera?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@enzogiordani It's obviously all lies when you mentioned winning that coffee machine. The rest is believable.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@thejourneyfan @nzphotomac I'm playing a game in about 30 minutes. In theory...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@alicecooke3 Compared to Tuesday, we did...
But yeah, such is football.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thekiwicanary In football, size isn't supposed to matter. In rugby, it does, especially when you're young.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall I lurk and lol. It's the only thing to do on the Internet.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall The FFA was right. That game in hand thing is really confusing for fans.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thekiwicanary I think 1970 Marton was a slightly different place...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thekiwicanary At that age it is. It's bloody hard to tackle a huge Islander. I know, I've done it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JonoNewton In his defence, travelling salesman is hard. Really, really hard.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall @enzogiordani And if you saw it every week, you'd get pretty bored of them pretty fast.
Shooting enthralling photos be hard.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@enzogiordani @yakcall Easy way to break your neck, I guess. My kit is heaps lighter than that and I gave up on neck straps already...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@enzogiordani @yakcall Maybe. It's a totally different perspective, which is getting them more admiration.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall @enzogiordani They're bloody heavy (3.85kg lens with 1.34kg body + batteries). He wouldn't want to.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@enzogiordani @yakcall He's shooting through a grate. Worse than shooting through a chain-link fence...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall You mean the spooning photo?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall I mean, it's cool and all, it's just not overly special. Me knowing nothing about NFL probably doesn't help...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall Yeah, but it's the kind of photos you'd get from a drone. If you could somehow attach a bigarse lens to it...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yakcall Yeah, I saw it. It's basically drone photography with $25k (and no idea of weight, but lots) of camera.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@thejourneyfan I remembered all by myself!
Going to be at the Phoenix on Saturday, and in your normal seat?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Or, @tacmoy has 5.6m of seat lying in the back yard that I'm going to mercilessly destroy over the weekend.
I like this one better.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'll have a go at it with a chainsaw over the weekend. Hopefully. Assuming I'm allowed to use the chainsaw...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Just measured. We have about 5.6m of tree lying in our back yard.]]></document>
