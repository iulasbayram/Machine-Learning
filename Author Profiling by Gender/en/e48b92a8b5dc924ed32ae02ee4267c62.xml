		<document><![CDATA[@MLKconservative Why don't you take a look at the evidence presented, instead of disregarding things without giving them a fair shake?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MLKconservative Maybe you actually don't know "liberals" &amp; "libs" that well, because I don't consider myself to be either.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@robbystarbuck Yes, it would also be hypocrisy then. It's hypocrisy no matter how you cut it; these rationalizations are all post hoc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@eth_KNEES First off, I'm not a "liberal" :). Second, I don't believe in unchecked power for anyone. I believe in a better economic system!]]></document>
