		<document><![CDATA[@SkyeMovies That's pretty close to mine. Personally, I'd have X-Men a little higher, and Apocalypse would be at the very bottom.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AaronDCarr1985 @Maximus_hound When I was young, I used to love Under Siege!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Maximus_hound Might rewatch it soon. Forgot that it was directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed The Fugitive, which I LOVE.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Maximus_hound I remember liking it, but that was years ago. I might have been wearing my Costner-tinted glasses at the time! Are you a fan?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ross_maclean Of course. Apart from that?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ross_maclean I'm definitely going back for more. What was the last film that resulted in more than two visits to the cinema?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Here's a picture of Kevin Costner reading the script for Criminal. https://t.co/qc4M4E42wn]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Things I liked about Criminal: 
1) It has a scene where Kevin Costner steals a kebab. 
2) The fact that Gary Oldman shouts 62% of his lines.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rachel_is_here Jonny Lee Miller's facial expression is spot on. 👍🏼]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ross_maclean You going for a third viewing?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SkyeMovies Agreed. How would you rank them?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thecinemascene I'm glad that it didn't. Logan looks great, and I like The Wolverine, although the final showdown is poor.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston are excellent, and the opening credits sequence is cool, but the film is a mess.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[X-Men Origins: Wolverine is worse than I remember.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The audience seemed to be completely engaged during the dramatic scenes, and they were laughing at all the funny bits. Very enjoyable. 👍🏼]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Favourite reactions to #OscarNoms:
1) I don't care. Do you hear me? I don't care!
2) WHAT DO YOU MEAN [INSERT FILM/ACTOR] WASN'T NOMINATED?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2016 was a banner year for cinematic moustaches. Thanks to Robert Carlyle, 2017 is off to a flying start. https://t.co/V8xt2aWGPZ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dene71 Those are very good examples.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I didn't love it, and the story wasn't as satisfying as I hoped, but there's a lot to like. Robert Carlyle has some great moments. 👨🏻]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That might sound might sound like an obvious thing to say, but many sequels don't manage it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One of the best things about Trainspotting 2 is that you feel like you're watching older versions of the characters from the first film.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It isn't as good as the first film, but that was never going to happen. Plus, it doesn't need to be. #T2trainspotting]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Trainspotting 2 has some big laughs, but it's a nostalgic film about the disappointments that come with middle age — and I'm okay with that.]]></document>

DoP: Robert Elswit
Dir: Stephen Gaghan

		<document><![CDATA[Just rewatched Dredd. I still think that it's pretty great. I still hope that we get a sequel from the same team.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Men In Black 3 is far from great, but it's worth watching for Josh Brolin, who does a *fantastic* impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[La La Land also made me like Ryan Gosling even more than I already did — and I didn't think that was possible. https://t.co/4RuXCppcSk]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I would have preferred La La Land without the musical sequences, but the film is very enjoyable, and the ending is heartbreaking.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Seated for La La Land. Bring on the joy!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I wanted to like Live By Night, but it is strangely uninvolving.  It feels like a three-hour 'epic' that has been cut down to two hours.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It is packed with gags and quotable lines. I was going to list my favourite moments, but there are too many to mention.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Just rewatched Alpha Papa, which is even better than I remember. Easily one of the best British comedy films of the last decade.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MarkSnowden77 For me, a suspenseful, low-key third act is preferable to a finale that goes big for the sake of going big.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rosstmiller You forgot about the Glasgow sequence. 😉]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CraigMinett Agreed. That whole sequence is spectacular.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sean_duncan I'm not sure about crashes, but The Living Daylights contains a superb plane sequence. The stunt work is outstanding.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@YellowDogAmisM That's the version I just watched — the "Extended Action Cut".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Ceilidhann I don't see why not. I would be very excited to see that movie.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Plus, the film has an impressive sense of scale, and it has more tension &amp; jeopardy than most of the event movies I've seen in recent years.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Just re-watched World War Z, which deserves a reappraisal. Yes, it's flawed, and there's too much CGI, but the set pieces are *fantastic*.]]></document>
