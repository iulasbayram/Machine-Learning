Well, maybe Horgan will go there soon so you can enjoy a Yellow Dog again.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@ausername @MadeleineSauve @bcliberals @jjhorgan @bcndp Ah, I thought so. Not even close to current &amp; somehow using numbers "beyond" 2021.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ausername @MadeleineSauve @bcliberals @jjhorgan Oops, wrong again.
If you think debt will shrink with @bcndp, look at Alberta's huge mess.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MadeleineSauve @bcliberals @jjhorgan @bcndp Wrong. The NDP has a history of hiking taxes &amp; destroying economies, so it's very believable.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@amlozyk It's despicable to see the massive waste from this @liberal_party govt and expect taxpayers to pay even more. Enough is enough!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pressprogress @acoyne @davidakin Gotta love all the nods of agreement by Justin's MP's. I wonder what they think of their leader today?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@awudrick Boom! Tweet of the day.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@FletJan @ElizabethMay @JustinTrudeau In another couple of years he'll dream up some shiny new promises. Remember then that he lied to win.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@katepurchase @jwaldag @FoxNews While we're at it, thank Justin for deleting #ERRE. What an incredible waste of time and money. Typical.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@FletJan @ElizabethMay Not to mention 10's of 10000's of tax dollars. How did May ever think @JustinTrudeau could be at all trustworthy?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@globalnews How many tax $ were carelessly thrown away on cross-country town-halls for #ERRE? @JustinTrudeau's incompetence grows daily.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patsow @steeletalks980 @RonaAmbrose @JustinTrudeau @CKNW It has absolutely nothing to do with Trump, nor does he care.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patsow @steeletalks980 @RonaAmbrose @JustinTrudeau @CKNW Do you have a clue what you're talking about? This is about a CANADIAN tax grab.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CKNW @JustinTrudeau Another commitment bites the dust from Canada's foolish and most incompetent PM.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patsow @steeletalks980 @RonaAmbrose @JustinTrudeau @CKNW Nonsense! The tax questions were crystal clear &amp; had nothing to do with US trade.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patsow @steeletalks980 @RonaAmbrose @JustinTrudeau @CKNW But can you believe Justin's Liberals? He danced all around yesterday's question.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Polkameister @JustinTrudeau If he doesn't "control" the preferred narrative, who will?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@turdeau Shouldn't the @JustinTrudeau's liberals demand that their beloved @CBCTheNational delete this #fakenews?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jimbo679 Absolutely. With ⬆ unemployment &amp; the fiscal disaster we're in, this seems like a much needed &amp; well-timed distraction doesn't it?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BrunoBets @RonaAmbrose Exactly. This reminded me of Justin's constant non-answers on his ridiculous costly selfie tour. He should be fired!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RonaAmbrose By skirting around a clear question, @JustinTrudeau shows his complete lack of respect of parliament &amp; all concerned Canadians.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thevinetwayway With that statement, YOU are the problem.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@vancouverfirst1 @schtev69 @NewsHour Hmm, very interesting. There's so much misinformation out there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@acoyne Oh probably - like if he copies Justin and starts doing stuff that's the opposite of what he said he'd do.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@daemalinowski @3S_miranda @CBCPolitics Thankfully, a minority.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@FraserAlaina @Dontvoteliberal @JustinTrudeau Good job. I doubt he'll reply until his massive debt is paid &amp; budget gets balanced though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chrisgailus He has a point. Media seems to be aiming more &amp; more for ratings instead of integrity - yes, including @GlobalBC.
Still cocky?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bojan99 @JJ_McCullough Good point. I'm pro-life but it's debatable whether government has any right or authority to dictate moral issues.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@liberal_party You've been warn Halifax. Hide anything that can be taxed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@schtev69 Whatever. Justin's not too famous for following rules anyway.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@amlozyk @tstewart666 I wonder why none of these were mentioned during the election campaign? Hmm. Middle-class and transparency be damned.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nspector4 @globeandmail Exactly. What could possibly go wrong with government funding the news media?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@490e7cdfa6a3489 @JustinTrudeau Huh? What's right for the country surely isn't a corrupt "big guy" saddling us with TRILLIONS in debt.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KAreYouSerious @CTV_Television Absolutely! A disgusting performance of misinformation. Is CTV hoping Justin will write them a cheque too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_Sylvia_1 Gotta love it how Justin scolds the crowd like children for booing interuptions but grins like a kid for cheering interuptions.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Shane_Peterson Hopefully off the head end.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gaylebg @CBC @CTVNews @globalnews Too true. When CBC thinks they can manipulate news, the others follow &amp; jump off the integrity ship too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Right_of_centre @peterdiane01 @BillTufts Exactly. I haven't found one election promise on a carbon tax. Promising a tax would be memorable.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gaylebg Isn't the media's job to report the news? It's clear the @CBC has resorted to inventing their own news. #fakenews professionals.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CanadianPM Many of us slightly older ones are advising you to quit while you're ahead, but you'll probably grin and ignore us too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Canadabuster @Canadabuster I suppose he "misspoke" about his short-term $10B debt and better transparency too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KenHardie @DianneLWatts I agree with govt streamlining where possible but I don't like playing games with info. Don't be like Justin there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KenHardie @DianneLWatts A better question is how many will take the demotion or uproot themselves/families and relocate?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KenHardie It's odd you'd be saying @DianneLWatts used wrong info (she refutes that) rather than standing up for 100's losing their jobs.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GenuWayne @andrewscheer Are you actually suggesting a Conservative MP running for party leadership is partisan? Shocking!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@live_tangent No idea what your point is, but you're welcome.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CPAC_TV @JustinTrudeau Although he actually said nothing of substance, he should at least get a star for the longest sentence contest.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@peterdiane01 @OhCanadiana @JustinTrudeau @CanadianPM And some of them even voted for him!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@live_tangent Elaborate? Hmm, my opinion that Justin is an idiot is as clear as I can make it in 144 characters. My page should fill it out.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@live_tangent @CandiceBergenMP Good point. Whenever I see @JustinTrudeau's "familiar" name, success doesn't come to mind at all. Idiot does.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@amlozyk @nationalpost By the sound of these results, I suspect the poll was only sent out to Liberal supporters.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KenWestQPS @sunlorrie Someone nearby said something annoying, her feet hurt, she had to pee, who knows? Obviously not you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KevinB_88 Maybe they didn't know an election was coming? "Internal wrestling" should be done by now - especially on big stuff like C tax.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Crush_Endo @JustinTrudeau But that's the whole idea. Do you really think he wants to hear from average working people?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GlennMcmillan14 @DailyCaller Yup, @JustinTrudeau's like a rock......only dumber.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@monica_barona @HuffPostCanada Now there's a surprise. But then, why wouldn't they find their own marketing department with taxpayer money?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@OttawaPolitico @liberal_party @CBC They have no reason to start now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kinsellawarren Old news. Try to keep up.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MarkOkanagan Haha. He just can't help himself can he?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@amlozyk @CBCNews It doesn't sound spiteful &amp; ill-mannered, it IS spiteful &amp; ill-mannered. I've come to expect nothing less from the CBC.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bermwalker @JJ_McCullough As much as I'd like to agree, I'm certain he has no clue what work is or how to help Canada. It's only about him.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Franktmcveety Thanks for the reminder Frank. It's sad that this evil gets lost on such an unimportant day as today. Never again!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@GeoffyPJohnston @POTUS Good question. It sure wasn't about exhibiting class or respect for the office.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@laura_payton @cafreeland @LisaLaFlammeCTV Haha. Trudeau Liberals are prepared for nothing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JustinTrudeau @jwaldag Your "town-halls" are a @liberal_party joke! What a completely irresponsible self-serving waste of taxpayer dollars!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RomeoWhiskyMike @GlobalBC @CTVVancouver Haha. I gave up CTV over a year ago and moved to Global. It seems they all use the same script.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[What's happened to @GlobalBC news? It's not news, it's a stupid gripe session - as bad as #CBCnews. Are we fresh out of resonable options?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Canadabuster Like they did with Trump? This could get good.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@steeletalks980 @CKNW Do we really need governments telling us how to live? We're already becoming a society of incompetent idiots.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@SusanIverach @Ottagonia Canada's pretty much broke. Now he's borrowing it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RomeoWhiskyMike @X3Breeze @McTeeth @dcracing_tony I think so. I doubt he'll win, but he'll sure spice up the campaign.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RomeoWhiskyMike @X3Breeze @McTeeth @dcracing_tony Agreed, but MSM will report his analysis of Justin's incompetence like no other player.]]></document>
