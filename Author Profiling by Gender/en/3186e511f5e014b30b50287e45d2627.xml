		<document><![CDATA[Very nice evening in Hastings with these great @NZGreens candidates and some of our supporters. https://t.co/IE4Zu2Xzna]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@andrew_hoggard Good read - thanks. "to date" needs a start point to be more informative though. @Lewisridge_Farm @dairymanNZ @m_herbert]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@RFStew Damn, planned to listen, but events conspired against me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Sam_Sheppo @m_herbert @tutukaus @dairymanNZ Some conversations would be easier over a beer (or six).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Lewisridge_Farm I've been asking for the numbers behind the survey for quite a while. Feel free to illuminate me. @dairymanNZ @m_herbert]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Sam_Sheppo Not sure what you're asking Sam. @m_herbert @tutukaus @dairymanNZ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@m_herbert The issue is the scale and growth of the industry and its impacts. It's bigger than individual farmers. @tutukaus @dairymanNZ 2/2]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@m_herbert I don't doubt that. I don't know how else to convey that you, and farmers like you are not the problem @tutukaus @dairymanNZ 1/2]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RodMullin Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment did a study a few years back. @m_herbert @dairymanNZ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tutukaus How would a campaign against palm oil help with NZ's water quality? @m_herbert @dairymanNZ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dairymanNZ You don't think the magical $1B has been used as propaganda even in the slightest? @m_herbert]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dairymanNZ So using $1B figure is just a neutral fact, but questioning it is "cheap sarcastic political point scoring"? OK then. @m_herbert]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tutukaus You've seen Greenpeace campaigning against palm oil too, right? @m_herbert @dairymanNZ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tutukaus I thought we were talking water quality? @m_herbert @dairymanNZ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@m_herbert @dairymanNZ But I do agree: water quality bottom lines should apply to all water, urban and rural. That's Greens policy BTW.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@m_herbert @dairymanNZ I imagine it's pretty simple: urban point sources account for ~5% of NZ water pollution. Go for big wins first?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dairymanNZ @m_herbert Asking for the numbers from a small, self-reported self-selected survey that was extrapolated to $1B is unreasonable?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dairymanNZ You're putting words in my mouth. @m_herbert]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dairymanNZ Not going to pretend that. But think about industry response to criticism. @m_herbert]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@m_herbert Maybe that's the only thing they have left when industry response is "Shut up / It's fine / Why do you hate farmers?" every time.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@m_herbert Part of the problem Matthew IMO, any critique of the *industry impacts* (not farmers personally) is met with hyperbole like that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wildantlers That joke's already been made ;-)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dairymanNZ @Kris_Bartley Speed of action and agreement on scale of the problem are the major issues IMO. The rest is noise.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@m_herbert Just pointing out the incongruity between the title of the PR and the content.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One might get the impression @DairyNZ are not entirely serious about working with @GreenpeaceNZ]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I find "we should be proud the ultra-rich want citizenship" as odious as "but they'll leave if we make them pay tax". Social contract much?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@bootstheory Sure, but wouldn't residency give the same benefit?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So have we gotten to the bottom of *why* Thiel particularly wanted citizenship, not just (unused) residency? Buy land? Party donations?]]></document>
