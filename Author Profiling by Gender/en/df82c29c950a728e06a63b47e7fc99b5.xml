		<document><![CDATA[@miejorgensen @rianne666 totally. She should think before she speaks x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@miejorgensen @rianne666 yeah she literally says his name for attention again x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@miejorgensen @rianne666 ugh that's horrible but not surprising from her. She seriously would do anything for attention x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rianne666 @miejorgensen oh no. What drama did I miss now? 😂 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@larrymybabiesx totally think he wouldn't be liking so many if it wasn't a good sign for season 4 😊 x]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Yes so much. Can we please get the season 4 trailer already 💚😂 x https://t.co/V7Jzw2DaFN]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rianne666 @Shannonbradfie3 don't get what the big deal is. So what if he did follow her anyway 😂 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nvanmeter the whole thing is ridiculous. Drama over nothing as usual 😂 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@larrymybabiesx @Jabberwocky_7 totally why is there drama over nothing 😂 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Blowjobshire same. You think by now it would be different x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Blowjobshire yeah. Ridiculous how they can't even stand next to someone without people saying they are dating x]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@JessxHazza true thats totally his style 😊😂 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JessxHazza same. Seems like he is more quiet than usual since he arrived 👀 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JessxHazza yeah so happy they have MIA time but miss him so much 💚😂 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@My_Joy_89 @Blowjobshire agree. They totally deserve it x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Blowjobshire @My_Joy_89 let's hope. Louis looks really happy now 😊💙  x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@My_Joy_89 @Blowjobshire true 😂. But especially since he hasn't really been seen since the airport 👀😂 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Blowjobshire totally. And another coincidence H has been MIA 😊💙💚 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@My_Joy_89 @LarryEvakAsFk yeah. At least H has a restraining order against her 😂 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@My_Joy_89 @LarryEvakAsFk totally. Nothing is surprising about that x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LarryEvakAsFk @My_Joy_89 totally. Let's hope he won't stop for her anymore x]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@nvanmeter yeah who cares what he might say in an interview. They are always scripted anyway x]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@butterfly73 @My_Joy_89 @larrymybabiesx @Blowjobshire I said this ages ago. Tarjei reminded me of Harry 💚😂 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LarryEvakAsFk didn't know that.  if they really did break up it could be a dig then x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LarryEvakAsFk exactly he could just say it was anything 😂 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LarryEvakAsFk same don't feel like he would tell us so easy 👀 x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Blowjobshire of all things I wasn't expecting it to be that   😊😂 x]]></document>
