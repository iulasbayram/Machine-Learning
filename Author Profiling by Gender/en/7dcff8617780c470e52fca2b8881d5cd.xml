		<document><![CDATA[@tinycg still local only!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@belbeeno oh and winston. I think if you're stuck it's best to practice new heroes so you can be more versatile!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@belbeeno yeah solo for the most part. I have a few heroes I'm good at across all roles: roadhog, dva, mei, zen, symm, soldier, reaper]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@GreyAlien @psysal @raiganburns @NoelFB @kylepulver haha yeah I believe it, and your games are great. I just couldn't resist :p]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GreyAlien @psysal @raiganburns @NoelFB @kylepulver for those breakneck match 3 speeds :P]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AnyelouPx maybe someday we'll make a towerfall sequel :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AnyelouPx it sounds cool but we moved on to our next project already! --&gt; https://t.co/TMOon1iCAs :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AnyelouPx sorry, 8-player is a separate EXE. I think you can add it to your steam library somehow though!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@raiganburns @psysal @NoelFB @kylepulver fixed is better for some games, but there's benefits to using delta in the code even if it's fixed]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@raiganburns @psysal @NoelFB @kylepulver IMO code everything in delta time, then set it to fixed if it fits the game]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Wow those GDCA nominee lists are stacked. What a crazy year for games. Congrats everyone!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes still figuring this stuff out for myself but the amount of "censorship" talk lately feels weird to me]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes censorship is when the government has to approve and edit your book before it is published, etc]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes I guess my point is we have laws and courts to protect from mob censorship. They def could still print the flag if they want]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes sure! I've been bullied for artistic choices, but never censored (thank god)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes censorship is when you take away the ability of an artist to choose. They still have the choice]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes but they can still decide to keep it. And if people still want it they'll still make $$. Backlash != Censorship]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes removing the flag was an artistic choice IMO. Could argue it was a bad one, but not censorship]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes I think "self-censorship" is an oxymoron! If no one forced you to change it, it's an artistic choice]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes I guess they must've weighed that against the amount of potential new fans they'd lose with the racism? Who knows]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes @floatvoid (if I owned that brand I'd also want to quietly distance it from that flag)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TommyRefenes @floatvoid looks more like the brand owners want to distance themselves from it than censorship? Doubt anyone forced them]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[The main thing I'm excited for in 2017 is finally releasing another game]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@zecmo @itchio sure! Thanks :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@zecmo @itchio oh do you have a crash log?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MllePilgrim @NoelFB yeah area 3 is gonna be so cool when noel and pedro are done with it haha]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@raiganburns @kylepulver @ColinNorthway haha yeah I've ranted about it in the past too. Literally roadblocks me every time i try unity]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@raiganburns @kylepulver @ColinNorthway yeah it pretty much sums up the argument to roll your own engine doesn't it]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ColinNorthway @kylepulver fuuuuck yes this is very good]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kylepulver @ColinNorthway or does the physics engine need update to run before the overlap "registers"?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kylepulver @ColinNorthway the real question is: can you move something, check for overlaps, then move it back same frame?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kylepulver @ColinNorthway solely event-based collisions just don't cut it if your game has to be responsive, imo]]></document>
