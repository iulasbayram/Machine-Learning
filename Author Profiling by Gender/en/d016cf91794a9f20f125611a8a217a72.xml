		<document><![CDATA[@kylealden @marypcbuk And that's a challenge all products have. Maybe I'm just not a Windows user, and so be it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kylealden @marypcbuk Yup, for differentiating features. Basic swipes etc are the same! Right-clicking is table stakes on desktop.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@marypcbuk @kylealden Targeting a diverse base is always challenging. Windows isn't wining me over until *my* basic expectations are meet.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@kylealden @anatudor @dstorey Well that's the thing. If I need "training" to use the trackpad, the product has failed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kylealden @anatudor @dstorey Example: 2 finger touch + click =&gt; right click on Mac. In Windows = nothing. Can't figure this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dstorey I agree. Touch is much more natural and a big win for Windows/Surface. But as a Mac user the Trackpad is root to frustration.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kylealden @anatudor @dstorey There's something about the precision &amp; delay which is different. Hard to describe, but damn frustrating.]]></document>
