		<document><![CDATA[@PizzaAbuser I was thinking about this the other day. Assassinate him and he becomes a Cheeto coated martyr for the ridiculous right]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Ugh. Predictable but awful. https://t.co/cutRHs9uWj]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I am having a horrible sinking feeling that bleach doesn't affect hair that is dyed dark.... Too late to back out now!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos the frequent elitism shown by upperclass male university students in MFMM at THE uni (i.e. Melb) is quite accurate. Still.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos there's one shot that I'm fairly certain is the Vic Supreme Court with all the court signs covered up.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos Miss Fisher's house is in Parkville, not St Kilda. I cannot figure out where City South Police Station is IRL.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos the offices of Women's Monthly in Away With The Fairies (S1) is Vic Trades Hall @VicUnions]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos the gentleman's club in Murder Most Scandalous is actually the rear entrance of @VicParliament]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos I love the locations - watching The Blood of Juana the Mad now (one with medical students.) This is shot at @unimelb]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos can't remember which one that is https://t.co/BJ7JkGSYMP]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos Yep! It's pretty clear by halfway through S1 that Cec + Burt are in for a penny, in for a pound because life is never dull]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos Yes. Phryne learns to respect the more demure ladies in the world, Dottie learns to stand up for herself and open her horizons]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos very last episode, where Phryne is flying her dad back to England, Jack drives out then runs up to the plane and they snog]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos they gradually stop protesting working for The Man (even if The Man is The Lady) and go along with Miss P's antics.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos if you go back and watch the first episode, Cec + Burt pick up Miss Fisher as a taxi client and she continues to employ them]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos trying to remember the order... have you seen the season where Phryne's Dad comes back to Melbourne and gets in strife?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos Cersei's reaction to wildfire when burning the Tower of the Hand makes me think Book C would use logic of Show C re battle]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos ready for married life - moving out of Miss P's house, not working anymore, being restrained and demure and all that]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos I love that Dottie gets slowly more and more feminist. Culminates in some brilliant stuff in S3 when Hugh pushes her to get]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos I know the stuff in S1 with Cec and Burt and their "red ragging" Commie buddies is on point - Nan and Pop were Commies :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos so then we have Dany the Mad Queen, Cersei killed for blowing up part of city too, and KL off the map, prob Dorne too]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos Dany arrives, doesn't believe that Aegon is legit, brings dragonfire to Dance and inadvertantly ignites her father's WF caches]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos Myrcella dies earlier in botched 'rescue' attempt as per Cersei's plans that Balon Swann thinks about]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos when Jaime finds out, this is what pushes him to valonquar. Tommen either dies in wildfire or at hands of FrankenGregor]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos yep. I think: Aegon storms KL. Cersei attempts to use wildfire in defence of Tommen, kills large portion of smallfolk]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos Have you seen the most recent season (S3)? THEY KISS AND OMG IT IS GLORIOUS]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos "I'd like to see you manage my sewing machine Hugh Collins!" 

Love it when Dottie gets all feminist on Hugh]]></document>

Pretty on point for gender and sociopolitics in MFMM.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos from my limited knowledge of pre-war Aus history, yes? Love the stuff like moron who thinks women are "biologically unsuited"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But the US President is sacking the acting A-G for DOING HER DAMN JOB and telling him that his policies are unlawful.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And the A-G was condemned for his part, and has been shuffled off to an ambassadorial post (because as if #auspol does responsible govt LOL)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Let's put all this in context. In Aus, the Solicitor-General (Justin Gleeson SC) resigned because the Attorney-General acted above the law]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos cannot stop laughing at Hugh's emotional "I've burned my footy scarf sir!" So typical of the stupidity of the average Melb man!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos for AFL though. Not for proper bloody football. A League has to struggle against not very thinly veiled racism - "wogball"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos it is also super, extremely Melbourne to be so caught up in drama about opposing football teams. Seriously. This place is nuts]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA["What's awkward compared to dying in the shower hung by the opposition's scarf?" 

Phryne putting things in perspective, as always :)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA["So? I'll just divide them up... girls for the West, boys for Abbotsford." 
"It's people like you that bring footy clubs down Dottie!"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I also adore this scene: "If Hugh marries me, I don't see why I should convert." "Because he'll want to take his kids to the footy!"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[b) the actual murder mystery is all sorts of intriguing, c) Jack's ex dramas, d) CEC + BURT C'MON...  https://t.co/IP2VBZ5mZR]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think the reason I like "Marked for Murder" so much is that a) not much has changed with Melbourne's fervour for football since the 1920s]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[My Miss Fisher binge is up to my favourite episode, the one with the footy dispute. "Marked for Murder." Some of Cec + Burt's best bickering]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@SallyRMelb trying to get her to stay still for one... argh. https://t.co/3793nmpcl6]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SallyRMelb I've my own fat cat. Ms Alice has a taste of gluttony - won't keep her nose of her brother's bowl, even though it makes her ill!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos also love that by S2, everyone has fallen into their roles e.g. Jack just going along with Phryne jumping off the pier]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos watching S2E3 Dead's Man Chest (the one in Queenscliff with the doubloons and temperance society.)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos as much as I hate the classist nature of Phryne's social peers, it is adorable to see Mr B taking the young guy under his wing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SallyRMelb @hpstorian @lizduckchong lovely floof]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos the only problem with Euro setting is that there's no way to loop in the rest of the gang in Melbourne (e.g. Mr B, Cec, Burt..)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos I love that Miss Fisher is so popular throughout US and UK. Always on lists of shows to binge on Netflix.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos they're apparently exploring options, like a Miss Fisher movie with Phryne in London (either as teen or adult)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos boo. This is the reason S4 MFMM isn't happening. Essie has her kids settled in UK and isn't willing to move them back for 6m.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos I also absolutely adore Miriam Margoyles as the utterly posh and judgemental Aunt Prudence.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos with both of them, it's the mix of good storytelling, acting and excellent production - use of Victoria's historic buildings]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GameOverRos Definitely one of the best shows that ABC has made in recent years, although the Dr Blake Mysteries not far behind.]]></document>
