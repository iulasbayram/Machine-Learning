		<document><![CDATA[@xfkirsten Yes, I can already see how difficult this must be from the other side of the world. Living there it must be terrifying]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@xfkirsten Yeah, the GOP narrative that the East &amp; West coasts are out of touch belies the fact the interior is so insular]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@deedot255 Well, sure. I think all the credits are at the end of La La Land but Pasek and Paul are in the fine print. Seems wrong]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@deedot255 Admittedly, in theatre the opposite happens. The lyricist is best known and the script/book writer is less known.]]></document>
