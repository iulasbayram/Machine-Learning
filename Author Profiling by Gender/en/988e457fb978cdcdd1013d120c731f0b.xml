		<document><![CDATA[@dimsie @gtiso I’m totally willing to swallow a lot of rats. Been involved in politics for too long not to. But some? Not even with sauce.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@shoelessgirl Yes &amp; no. But I can’t vote if such a vote is across a moral line for me. O’Connor isn’t my only concern, but he adds to such.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gtiso @dimsie This my quandary, and that rat may indeed be too big to swallow.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@amscraig @hadyngreen Thank you! Will add that to my autocorrect.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@amscraig @hadyngreen Yeah, living in Wadestown, my electorate shifted on me, moving me from Wellington Central to Ohariu. So very aware.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thomasbeagle @kyhwana No, it’s moved to Miramar.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tui_talk @lcsnz Oh, I don’t expect them to rule it out, as much as I would like them to. But if they appear to be considering it, then no.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz Indeed, and it should. The choice scares me, because of how much I believe in our institutions. But I will wield it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz This is why I am weighing this choice so heavily. And why I may not be the only one doing so.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tui_talk @lcsnz As I said, if the Greens put up an alternative in Ohariu, AND do not look to partner with NZF in gov, then I’ll vote.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tui_talk @lcsnz No. But I have a line I will not cross.. If those are the consequences I will be sad. But I will not do anything to win.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz Why do you think I am resisting resigning my Greens membership? Your thought that I am doing this lightly is insulting.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tui_talk @lcsnz I’m sorry, but giving in to whatever they want in order to win, including partnering with NZF, is not something I will do.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tui_talk @lcsnz No, my main priority is voting to my morals, NZF is but just aspect.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz I will not stand by and say “anything to win” for if we do that, we’re not truly winning.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz That voting is a tool, to be used with power, and responsibility, and import. Not to be taken for granted. By anyone.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tui_talk @lcsnz The more we give over votes to them regardless of what they do, or who they partner with, the more they will do so.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz … government, THEN I will vote. But if they do not, I will not.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz IF the Greens put up an alternative to O’Connor in Ohariu, and IF Greens/Labour do not appear to be considering NZF for …]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz To those in the parties of the left that they cannot take our votes for granted. However small of such.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz Sometimes, the act of not voting is an act in and of itself. If it is with intent &amp; reason and engagement in the politics.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz This is not a question of if one must compromise, because of course one must. But rather of where is too far.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz It is indeed, but there comes a point where the compromise is too much, and I will not meekly hand over my vote.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz … will not compromise beyond where I consider moral. Look down on me as you will, but I will draw a line.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz …operates or how to get involved. Elections are HUGE for me. But I do all this because of what I believe in, and I …]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz I have campaigned, lobbied, staffed, sat-in, marched, walked the line. In the last election I worked a booth for James …]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz Of course I have hon. Do you honestly think I haven’t? My disappointment goes beyond O’Connor.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz If I cannot vote my principles, then voting becomes meaningless to me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz I know, which is why I am considering abstaining seriously and with import.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz Me too, but I can’t see acceding to whatever the left parties do is a solution.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lcsnz @mysphoria She did indeed, but the “vote for her or else” method that was used by many was not successful]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz Opting out of voting is a viable choice. It’s an extreme one, but it is one I am prepared for if I can’t vote my consience]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lcsnz @mysphoria Except in the states that mattered. Like it or not (and I don’t personally) the electoral college was where it mattered.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mysphoria @lcsnz Sure, please, try to shame me into voting. That worked excellently for Clinton’s camp too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lcsnz They need to learn that they cannot take our votes for granted. That there are limits to our complicity.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@li_politico I KNOW. Turned that shit off as soon as I found I could.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@southernlimitnz Though if someone disrespects the Oxford Comma, all bets are off.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@li_politico Yes, some of us are intellectuals AND love Harry Potter AND love seeing people use whatever literature to engage with the world]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thelittlepakeha @reaverbait All literature wishes it had the power to do that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thelittlepakeha @reaverbait Exactly, it’s something that people know, and love, and use to make sense of the world around them, to express.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@buzzandhum There’s a reason it’s a cultural touchstone, and resonates with so many. It has power in that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@southernlimitnz I will admit, I’ve been guilty of that in the past. Been something I’ve tried to get myself out of in the past few years.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@reaverbait But even if I didn’t, I won’t imply their stupidity just for choosing that particular literature to engage through.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@reaverbait I’ve read a LOT of books, and I’ve on the whole liked &amp; enjoyed the Potter-universe comparisons.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@reaverbait For instance, how do you know this the only book/series they have read? They’ve merely chosen to engage through this piece.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@msvaf Yeah, I feel the same. May not be official as yet, but they’ll do it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lcsnz I’m not taking this lightly. Voting is about as close to a sacred act as it comes for me. But my conscience will not let me on these.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lcsnz I’m sorry hon, but there are lines on how I’m willing to compromise on when voting. And these are over such.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lcsnz If the Greens/Labour look like partnering with NZF to form a government, then my party vote will be withheld too.]]></document>
