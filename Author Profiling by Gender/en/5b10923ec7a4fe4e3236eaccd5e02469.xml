		<document><![CDATA[@NZ_Dave after the games now too. But that's just thinking about myself haha]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@NZ_Dave Possibly. Crowds were certainly better at the "curtain raiser" games last year. It'll be nice to be able to enjoy a couple of beers]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@NZ_Dave I have zero idea if this is the case though]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@NZ_Dave Are they not effectively curtain raisers like the Saturday games they played last year? Those were great for crowds too]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@d_m_ab hah! The sellouts are still by far my best local. They won't be losing me from there anytime soon!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@d_m_ab craft brewers rather than putting more money towards Lion Red haha]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@d_m_ab Yeah but they're still owned by Lion now aren't they? Don't get me wrong, the beers still good but I prefer supporting the small]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KloppGoff @SWTGallagher Do they have prices yet? The others of these I've seen tend to be pretty pricey. I want to get into one for sure]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@d_m_ab Not at all.. they're owned by a massive brewery. They don't meet the craft brewery label by any stretch.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@d_m_ab beers than anyone with peak creativity]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@d_m_ab I love Emersons but I'd hardly call them a craft brewer. Look at Garage, they're outdoing anyone themselves and putting out more]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SWTGallagher @KloppGoff I'd love it... I just know how shit I'd be. Chemistry is way over my head haha]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SWTGallagher Yep 100% agree. The proof is there it can be done without selling out to the big brewers too. More crafts the merrier]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@d_m_ab and it's not pumping out the extensive numbers of their basic beers like other "craft" breweries under big brewery ownership]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@d_m_ab Nothing to do with making money.It's about the product. I'm just a bigger fan of craft breweries focusing on what makes them awesome]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KloppGoff they've got be careful and ease into these big changes. Having to focus on the bigger output. Doesn't mean they won't make good]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 @KloppGoff @patrick478 Nothing hipster about it. It's good to support locals providing the goods.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SWTGallagher the good news is there's more and more small brewers stepping up. This will put them towards the craft levels of Macs Brewery]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KloppGoff @Tegal1234 @patrick478 A big part of the appeal is also supporting a local craft brewer. Not big batch brewing. Disappointing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SWTGallagher completely. A big reason is wanting to support the local brewers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jessej1977 At what point does it stop being a craft brewer though? Curious about that]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 @patrick478 What makes you think the beer stays the same? Big brewing. It's like expecting that Hell Pizza would stay the same]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SmithyInWelly Haha wouldn't have been bad being able to enjoy a few more qualities beverages off the back of the truck]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 At what point do they stop being "craft" breweries? At least Garage have committed to doing it themselves]]></document>
